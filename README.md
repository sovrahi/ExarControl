ExarControl is an unofficial Android app that lets you control your Exaroton servers directly from your smartphone. With a lightweight and intuitive interface, you can access your servers, manage settings, restart servers, and more—all without opening your browser !

Tested on Android 15 and Android 10, but should work on most phones. Let me know if you have a problem.

🚀 Key Features:

    📂 Server Management: Start, stop, and restart your Exaroton servers with just a tap.
    📈 Real-Time Monitoring: Check your server's RAM usage.
    💬 Integrated Console: Send commands to your server straight from the app.
    👥 Manage Player List: Easily manage the players on your server.
    🔄 Change MOTD or RAM/CPU: Customize your message of the day and adjust allocated resources.
    🎨 Simple and Modern UI: Designed for fast and efficient mobile use.

🔒 Disclaimer:

ExarControl is not affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Exaroton. Please use this app with this understanding.
The API token is saved on your device only, with basic security because I don't know more, but in short it stays with you.
This is my first android application and it's far from perfect.

💡 Coming Soon:

    Support Acces Limited Account (It works now but it's buggy)
    🔔 Notifications: Get real-time alerts about your server's status.
    🌐 Multilingual Support.
    And more if I have ideas!

🛠️ Installation:

    Download the APK from the Releases section.
    Install it on your Android device.
    Log in to your Exaroton account with an API token and start managing your servers!

Here's the interface (which I'm going to improve, don't worry) it works in dark mode and light mode:
